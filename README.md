# brax-editable
X-Editable alternative (inline editing) without jQuery

It requires (and bundles) [Tippy.js](https://github.com/atomiks/tippyjs) & [Choices](https://github.com/jshjohnson/Choices) though.

# Usage

Check "index.php" for examples.


# Input types

- text
- select
- choices
- datetime
- [other value for raw input type]


# TODO

~~Make fields appear in tooltip instead of inline~~

Support more input types?

Better datetime input?

Make smaller somehow, i don't know what causes it, the separate imported libraries don't add up...
